## 🏗️ Platform Architecture Summary

### Vision
Transform from a simple agent builder into a **"GitHub for AI Agents"** - a thriving marketplace where users create, share, and collaborate on AI agent solutions.

### Core Components

**Frontend (React/TypeScript)**
- AgentBuilder: Main agent creation interface
- Marketplace: Browse and discover community content
- ScenarioBuilder: Create business scenarios (manual + PDF upload)
- SimulationRunner: Execute CrewAI simulations

**Backend (FastAPI + PostgreSQL)**
- RESTful API with comprehensive endpoints
- Enhanced database schema with marketplace features
- Community features (ratings, reviews, collections)
- Version control and attribution system

**Key Features**
- 🤖 **Agent Builder**: Create custom agents with role, goal, backstory, tools
- 🏪 **Marketplace**: Public sharing with ratings, reviews, and discovery
- 📊 **Scenarios**: Business case scenarios (manual creation + PDF upload)
- ⚡ **Simulations**: CrewAI-powered multi-agent collaborations
- 👥 **Community**: Collections, favorites, reputation system
