# Scenario Builder Completion Plan

## Current Status âœ…
- âœ… Login working correctly
- âœ… Database schema supports agent-scenario-task relationships  
- âœ… API endpoints return scenarios with agents and tasks arrays
- âœ… Frontend interfaces match backend properly
- âœ… Simulation page no longer crashes

## Missing Implementation ðŸ”§

### 1. Scenario Builder Needs Agent/Task Assignment
**Current**: Scenarios are created but have no agents or tasks assigned
**Needed**: Complete the scenario building workflow

#### Frontend Changes Needed:
```typescript
// In Scenario Builder (/scenario-builder/page.tsx)
// Add steps to:
1. Select or create agents for the scenario
2. Define tasks for those agents  
3. Assign tasks to specific agents
4. Save the complete scenario with relationships
```

#### Backend Changes Needed:
```python
# Add endpoints to manage scenario relationships:
POST /scenarios/{id}/agents          # Add agents to scenario
POST /scenarios/{id}/tasks           # Add tasks to scenario  
POST /scenarios/{id}/agent-tasks     # Assign tasks to agents
```

### 2. CrewAI Integration in Simulation Runner
**Current**: Simulation just shows placeholder responses
**Needed**: Actual CrewAI crew execution

#### Implementation:
```python
# In simulation endpoints:
1. Load scenario with its agents and tasks
2. Create CrewAI Agent instances from database agents
3. Create CrewAI Task instances from database tasks
4. Create and execute CrewAI Crew
5. Return real simulation results
```

### 3. Task Management System
**Current**: Tasks exist in database but aren't used
**Needed**: Full task CRUD and assignment system

#### Features to add:
- Task creation interface
- Task templates for common business scenarios  
- Task assignment to agents
- Task dependency management
- Expected output definition

## Recommended Implementation Order ðŸŽ¯

### Phase 1: Complete Scenario Builder (High Priority)
1. **Agent Selection Step** - Allow users to select existing agents or create new ones
2. **Task Definition Step** - Let users define what tasks need to be completed
3. **Agent-Task Assignment** - Assign specific tasks to specific agents
4. **Scenario Preview** - Show the complete crew setup before saving

### Phase 2: Enhanced Task System (Medium Priority)  
1. **Task Builder Page** - Dedicated page for creating reusable tasks
2. **Task Templates** - Pre-built tasks for common business scenarios
3. **Task Categories** - Organize tasks by type (analysis, research, planning, etc.)

### Phase 3: Full CrewAI Integration (Medium Priority)
1. **Real Crew Execution** - Replace placeholder responses with actual CrewAI
2. **Streaming Results** - Real-time updates during simulation
3. **Result Analysis** - Detailed performance metrics and insights

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Lower Priority)
1. **Scenario Templates** - Pre-built scenario + agent + task combinations
2. **Community Sharing** - Share complete scenarios with agent/task setups  
3. **Version Control** - Track changes to agents, tasks, and scenarios

## Immediate Next Steps ðŸš€

1. **Test the current setup**: Try creating a scenario and see what happens in simulation
2. **Add agent selection to scenario builder**: Let users pick agents during scenario creation
3. **Add task definition to scenario builder**: Let users define tasks for the selected agents
4. **Test end-to-end flow**: Create scenario â†’ assign agents/tasks â†’ run simulation

The foundation is solid! We just need to complete the business logic for properly linking agents, tasks, and scenarios together according to the CrewAI framework.
